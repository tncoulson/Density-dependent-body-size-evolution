The files will produce the results in Coulson et al. Density-dependent environments can select for extremes of body size.  

Place all files in the same directory, edit paths as necessary, and run lh_trade_offs_surv_dd.R.  The outputs are in the array outp.

To run the density-dependent juvenile survival scenario modify the values in params.r to take the values in Table 2 in the paper.

Feel free to contact tim.coulson@biology.ox.ac.uk for additional information.
